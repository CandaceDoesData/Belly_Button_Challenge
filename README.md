# Belly_Button_Challenge
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Complete the following steps:

  1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-               classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

  2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

  3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

  4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
  
  5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

  6. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would          like for your dashboard.

  7. Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your      GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file

  8. Adapt the Gauge Chart from https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/ to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

  9. You will need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.

  10. Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.
